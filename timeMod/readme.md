# Time Mod  

Allows to stop time and advance it frame by frame, useful when debugging logic circuits. On multiplayer only the host can use it.  

Controls:  
N: Toggle stop time  
M: Advance time 1 frame, only works if time is stopped  
-: Reset elapsed time counters, only works if time is stopped  

Disclaimer: physics might get a bit weird when advancing time frame by frame.
