# Conway's Game of Life  

Allows to play "Conway's Game of Life" in game using my "Screen Utilities" mod, which can be found here: https://github.com/ALVAROPING1/Trailmaker-mods/tree/master/ScreenUtilities  

Configurable settings:  
- Horizontal resolution  
- Vertical resolution  
- Game speed  

Note: on multiplayer, only the host can use it as loading a screen can cause a big fps drop (specially in the case of higger resolutions)  

Disclaimer: Higher resolutions require a powerful pc in order to not crash while loading the screen
