# Bad Apple!!  

Allows to play "Bad Apple!!" in game with different resolutions and framerates using my "Screen Utilities" mod, which can be found [here](https://github.com/ALVAROPING1/Trailmaker-mods/tree/master/ScreenUtilities)  

Included versions  

- 80x60 1fps  
- 60x45 3fps  
- 48x36 7.5fps  
- 40x30 15fps  
- 32x24 30fps  

Note: on multiplayer, only the host can play them as loading a screen can cause a big fps drop (specially in the case of the bigger resolutions)  

Disclaimer: The higher resolutions require a powerful pc in order to not crash while loading them
